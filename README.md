# Java E-commerce Backend - Open Source Project

## Overview

Welcome to the [Java E-commerce Backend open-source - shopdevjava.com](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCky92hx0lZxVBi2BJ6Zm2Hg/join) project! This project aims to build a backend system for an e-commerce platform similar to Shopee (Version LITE). Our goal is to provide a robust, scalable, and flexible system to handle core e-commerce functionalities such as product management, orders, payments, inventory, etc.
